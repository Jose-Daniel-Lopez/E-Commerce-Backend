/**
 * Service class responsible for handling business logic related to {@code Payment} operations.
 * <p>
 * This service acts as a dedicated layer between the controller and repository,
 * designed to encapsulate payment-specific workflows such as:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Initiating payments via external gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal)</li>
 *   <li>Validating payment status and amounts</li>
 *   <li>Handling callbacks or webhooks from payment providers</li>
 *   <li>Mapping transaction responses and updating order status</li>
 *   <li>Supporting refunds, retries, or failed payment handling</li>
 *   <li>Ensuring idempotency in payment processing</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Currently, this class holds a reference to {@link PaymentRepository}
 * and is structured to support future implementation of these critical features.
 * All data persistence and retrieval operations are delegated to the repository.
 * </p>
