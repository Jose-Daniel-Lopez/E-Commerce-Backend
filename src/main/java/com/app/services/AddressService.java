 * </p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Validating address data before persistence</li>
 *   <li>Enriching address information (e.g., geocoding)</li>
 *   <li>Handling cascaded operations involving addresses</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * At present, this service is minimal and acts as a placeholder for future logic.
 * All data operations are delegated to the injected repository.
